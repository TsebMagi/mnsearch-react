### data

### features

- a few concise instructions would be helpful. e.g. click on header to sort,
  click again to sort in reverse, click on card to see details. the filters
  kind of speak for themselves.

- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)
  [ ] show cards that have ALL regions selected
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.
- possible filter: subtype (some cards have this)
- in card details:
  - show starting cards
  - show energize
  - there's also a shadow_play attribute
- some cards, like O'Qua, have a cost associated with a power... we need to
  show this. (use power.cost if it exists)
- it would be useful to be able to click on a checkbox's *text* to select that
  checkbox. 
  - make a custom component that does this?

### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
- same for sets
- show the sort arrow in a different color
  - we could create a new component SortArrow for this, or something
  - in fact, the table headers could also be their own component... but no rush :)

### misc

- when sorting by region, do we put the multi-regions together? or do we just
  sort by the first region and then by original order (i.e. card name)?
  - problem is, if you do a reverse sort, the names are *also* sorted in reverse.

- flavor text often contains newlines, which should really be rendered as
  <br>s in HTML. 
  - maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616226/insert-html-with-react-variable-statements-jsx
  - also quotes need to be kept!
