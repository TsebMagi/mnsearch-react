# TODO

### data


### features

- sort by columns
  - need some kind of indicator for the sort order, like an arrow
- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.
- possible filter: subtype (some cards have this)
- in card details:
  - show subtype, if any (e.g. Bone Grag)
  - show starting cards
  - show energize
  - there's also a shadow_play attribute
- some cards, like O'Qua, have a cost associated with a power... we need to
  show this. (use power.cost if it exists)

### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
- same for sets
- show an arrow (up/down) next to the field we're sorting by

### misc

- sorting is too slow!
  - in fact, so is everything else :(
- how do we sort by region? this is a list that sometimes contains 2 items
  - we could sort by the first one?
    - this means multi-region cards no longer appear next to each other, which
      is probably good (in this case)
- sorting of strings (names, mostly) should be done by lowercase, so names
  starting with "d'" don't end up at the end.
  - but, not every field we can sort on is a string. so we cannot simply use
    toLowerCase()

- add a link 'about' or something, which brings up (makes visible) a panel
  with information about the author, etc
  - close to make invisible again
- everything seems a little too sluggish when we're dealing with a full
  list of cards. figure out how we can improve that. 
- flavor text often contains newlines, which should really be rendered as
  <br>s in HTML. 
  - maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616226/insert-html-with-react-variable-statements-jsx
  - also quotes need to be kept!
