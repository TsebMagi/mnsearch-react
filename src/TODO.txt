# TODO

### data

- add MRPs (http://bluefurok.com/MRP_index.htm)
  (suggested by Reddit user)
  - I will need to scrape and extract those, and provide a separate data file
    - if it's big, probably load it on demand (i.e. when someone asks for MRP
      data of a card) and then show it (as opposed to loading all the data when
      the React app starts)
    - since it's per card, I wonder if we could provide some kind of simple
      read-only API here

### filtering

- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region only (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
      - doesn't really sound very useful
  [ ] EXclude promos (but what will this do if we check Promos)
  [ ] EXclude unreleased sets (but what does this do if we check TR)
  [ ] show cards that have ALL regions selected
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - there could be a dropdown defaulting to "contains", but which also has
    "starts with" and "ends with".
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.
    - it would make sense to search for effect names, since effects with the
      same names sometimes appear on different cards. (e.g. Weave)
    - also subtypes
    - and starting cards
    - and card text
    - even flavor text can be searched, like in the old MNS, but I am not sure
      how useful this is in practice 
  - idea: put a similar layout under "name contains: [...]" that looks like
    [content] contains [...]"
    - this should be lined up properly, which isn't as easy as it seems :(
      - unless I use a good old table
    - content can be any of the stuff above (except name)


### card details

- there's also a shadow_play attribute
- also: card.alternate (e.g. Fiend of Furoks)
- some creatures have an energize attribute as well; show it
  (e.g. Tropical Hyren)
- it would be useful to be able to click on a checkbox's *text* to select that
  checkbox. 
  - make a custom component that does this?

### search results

- if certain card types are selected, maybe we can show an additional column
  in the search results. for example, if Magi is selected, we could show an
  energize column; it would make sense to sort by that.

### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
- same for sets
- show the sort arrow in a different color
  - we could create a new component SortArrow for this, or something
  - in fact, the table headers could also be their own component... but no rush :)
- some effects have no name (e.g. Zyavu); in that case, don't show the "-" after
  "Effect" in the card details.

### misc

- when sorting by region, do we put the multi-regions together? or do we just
  sort by the first region and then by original order (i.e. card name)?
  - problem is, if you do a reverse sort, the names are *also* sorted in reverse.

- flavor text often contains newlines, which should really be rendered as
  <br>s in HTML. 
  - maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616226/insert-html-with-react-variable-statements-jsx
  - also quotes need to be kept!

- in the list of starting cards, we could make the cards clickable links,
  that open the card in question?
  - what do we do if the current filters don't show that card?
  - with the current settings, it would close the original card, which
    may be annoying.

- should we provide unique URLs for each card somehow?
  - what would they point to? separate page? or show the list with that card open?

### cleanup/refactoring

- if CheckBox turns out to work well, use it everywhere

### README/instructions

- In the README, add a link to some site that explains what Magi-Nation is...
  perhaps several sites
