### data

- regions need to be a list of names in cards.json
  (right now there's a string 'region' containing one or two regions as text)
- some of the multi-region cards show up twice (like Bog Wellisk), while others
  do not (Curse of the Abaquist)
  - this is because we ignore references instead of handling them properly.
    i.e. they are basically a copy of an existing card, but with the regions
    switched!

### features

- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)

### display

- multi-region cards show up twice in the results, do we need to remove
  duplicates?
  (tentative answer: no)
  (in fact, we need to add them for some cards; see above)
