# TODO

- We should pass SearchResults just the cards that it needs to display. Filtering
  and sorting needs to be done beforehand, then the sorted/filtered array needs
  to be passed to SearchResults.

- Show some filter/search/sort options
- Figure out how to use those options to actually produce a sorted/filtered list
  (must be done in App)
- Changing the text should filter the card list directly
  (implement this first)

### data

- regions need to be a list of names in cards.json
  (right now there's a string 'region' containing one or two regions as text)
