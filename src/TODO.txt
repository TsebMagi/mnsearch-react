# TODO

- We should pass SearchResults just the cards that it needs to display. Filtering
  and sorting needs to be done beforehand, then the sorted/filtered array needs
  to be passed to SearchResults.

- Show some filter/search/sort options
- Figure out how to use those options to actually produce a sorted/filtered list
  (must be done in App)
