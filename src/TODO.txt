# TODO

- Show some filter/search/sort options
- Figure out how to use those options to actually produce a sorted/filtered list
  (must be done in App)
- Changing the text should filter the card list directly
  (implement this first)

### data

- regions need to be a list of names in cards.json
  (right now there's a string 'region' containing one or two regions as text)

### features

- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)

### display

- show checkbox panels properly, i.e. panels next to each other, aligned
  properly
