# TODO

### data


### features

- click on search result to show card image and full info
  - figure out how to do this
  - should only one card be "open" at a time, or any number? (may be slow)
- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.
- possible filter: subtype (some cards have this)
- sort by columns
  - need some kind of indicator for the sort order, like an arrow
- in card details:
  - show subtype, if any (e.g. Bone Grag)
  - show starting cards
  - show energize

### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
- same for sets

### misc

- add a link 'about' or something, which brings up (makes visible) a panel
  with information about the author, etc
  - close to make invisible again
- everything seems a little too sluggish when we're dealing with a full
  list of cards. figure out how we can improve that. 
- flavor text often contains newlines, which should really be rendered as
  <br>s in HTML. 
  - maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616226/insert-html-with-react-variable-statements-jsx
  - also quotes need to be kept!
