### data

### features

- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)
  [ ] show cards that have ALL regions selected
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - there could be a dropdown defaulting to "contains", but which also has
    "starts with" and "ends with".
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.
- possible filter: subtype (some cards have this)
- in card details:
  - show starting cards
  - there's also a shadow_play attribute
- it would be useful to be able to click on a checkbox's *text* to select that
  checkbox. 
  - make a custom component that does this?

### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
- same for sets
- show the sort arrow in a different color
  - we could create a new component SortArrow for this, or something
  - in fact, the table headers could also be their own component... but no rush :)
- some effects have no name (e.g. Zyavu); in that case, don't show the "-" after
  "Effect" in the card details.

### misc

- when sorting by region, do we put the multi-regions together? or do we just
  sort by the first region and then by original order (i.e. card name)?
  - problem is, if you do a reverse sort, the names are *also* sorted in reverse.

- flavor text often contains newlines, which should really be rendered as
  <br>s in HTML. 
  - maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616226/insert-html-with-react-variable-statements-jsx
  - also quotes need to be kept!
