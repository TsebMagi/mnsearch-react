# TODO

### data

- add the image name
  (in the Python version, this is generated on demand, but I don't want to do
  that in Javascript right now)

### features

- show more fields
- later: click on search result to show card image and full info
- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.

### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
