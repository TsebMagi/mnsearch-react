### data


### features

- show more fields
- later: click on search result to show card image and full info
- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] multi-region
  [ ] single-region   (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
  [ ] include promos (but this is the same as checking PR)
  [ ] include unreleased sets (but this is the same as checking TR)

### display

- show search results in alternating colors
- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
