# CHANGELOG

version 0.9:

- added text (other than effects/powers) to card details
- added a number of filters for subtype, whole card, effects, powers,
  also less-useful stuff like artists and flavor text :3
- fixed a number of (fairly minor) bugs in the YAML source files
- added a filter to select only the cards that have *all* the regions
  selected (effectively an AND instead of an OR), so users can search
  for specific multi-region cards only (and ignore single-region cards)
- minor update to instructions

version 0.8.1:

- in card details, display "{region} Shadow Magi" for Shadow Magi
